# 100DaysOfCode

ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, today I'm starting this challenge of 100 consecutive days studying programming, my main motivations for starting and publishing this challenge are:
1. Have a place that contains all my studies filed.
2. Start studying programming also on weekends.
3. Possibly help others in the future.
4. Have a github contributions board green ksksks.
